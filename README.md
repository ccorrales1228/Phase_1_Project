## Overview
This project will focus on data gathering and analysis to aid Microsoft's business stakeholders on their new venture into the box office space. We gatherd our usable data from both [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/?ref_=bo_nb_cso_mojologo) and [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/?ref_=nv_home) so generate a descriptive analysis on how best Microsoft can optimize their debut for the most success. 

## Business Problem
As a leader within the technology space, Microsoft has decided to embark on a new venture in the movie space. With the movie industry being novel territory for Microsoft, the organziation is looking for direction for their first film. 

## Data
In the folder labeled data csv gathered through API and webscraping from:
IMDB, TheMovieDB.org, and Box Office Mojo

### Webscraped Data
IMDB: The data from IMDB's Top 1000 Movies that was webscraped consist of the following: movie, year, time_minute, genre, imdb_rating, metascore, vote, and gross_earning.
Box Office Mojo: The data used were worldwide lifetime box office earnings, foreign box office earnings, and domestic lifetime earning

### API
TheMovieDB.org: Data caputure via API were from TheMovieDb's TOP RATED section from their database. Please note, although we captureed data via API, we decided to not use the data as the webscraped data from IMDB and Box Office Mojo were enough for our analysis.
